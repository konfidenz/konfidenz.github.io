## Idea

**Humans are able to report their subjective certainty about decisions, actions or perceptions. We believe that such subjective certainty – or confidence – can be used as a learning signal to reinforce neural circuitry involved in these processes. We refer to this form of learning as confidence-based learning.**

Our goal is to establish this potential novel form of learning using psychophysical, physiological and neuroimaging measurements. To understand the mechanisms of confidence-based learning, we devise computational models and test them through simulation and data-driven model comparison.
